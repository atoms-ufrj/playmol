Introduction      {#mainpage}
============

Playmol is a(nother) software for building molecular models.

Its main distinguishing features are:

* Molecules are created with simple scripts consisting of a small set of [commands](commands.html).
* Molecular topology arises naturally when atoms are connected (automatic detection of angles and
dihedrals).
* Multiple copies of a molecule are automatically created when new coordinates are defined for their
atoms.
* Integration with [Packmol] \cite Martinez_2009 provides a way of creating complex molecular
systems.
* Generation of [LAMMPS] \cite Plimpton_1995 and [OpenMM] \cite Eastman_2017 files provides a way
of performing efficient MD simulations.

The sections of this manual are:

* [Installation](install.html): provides instructions for Playmol installation
* [Playmol Basics](basics.html): explains the working logic of Playmol
* [Commands](commands.html): describes all Playmol commands
* [Sample Scripts](scripts.html): provides sample Playmol scripts
